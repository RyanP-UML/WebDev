                Hi, welcome to my website. This is a testing ground for me to try
                new web-development skills. I will be trying all sorts of stuff
                in HTML5, css, javascript, jquery, and much more.
            </p>

        <section id="main">
            <img src="pics/door.jpg"/><br><br>
            <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Go to Google</a><br><br>

            <form>
                <textarea class="text" placeholder="Skriver noe"></textarea>

            </form>

            <p class="copy-pasta">Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time
                I close my eyes. Someone had brought their new gaming laptop to class. The
                Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started
                sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop.
                He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the
                process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's
                thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that
                there's nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are
                running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them.
                The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The
                colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash,
                and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power
                grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to
                spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth
                shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force
                winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans. As my body finally
                surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming
                laptops.</p>
